# top-js-f-calculator

## Overview

This project is a functional on-screen calculator built to showcase core skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It demonstrates both technical competency and attention to user experience through a clean design, responsive interactions, and robust error handling.

## Key Features

1. **Core Arithmetic Functions**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with each function independently tested for accuracy.

2. **Operate Function**: Implements a flexible function that takes an operator and two numbers, executing calculations efficiently for a modular codebase.

3. **User Interface (UI)**:

   - **HTML Layout**: Simple, intuitive layout with buttons for numbers, operators, and an equals button for calculation.
   - **Display Area**: Real-time feedback for inputs and results.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **Division by Zero**: Custom error messages handle edge cases, preventing crashes.
   - **Clear Function**: Resets all variables and display content to ensure consistent usability.

### Bonus Features

1. **Chained Calculations**: Handles one calculation at a time, showing intermediate results.
2. **Floating Point Support**: Allows decimal inputs and prevents multiple decimal points.
3. **Backspace & Keyboard Support**: Enhances user control with keyboard input and undo functionality.

## Development Process

- **Modular Testing**: Each function was tested independently, simplifying debugging and ensuring quality.
- **Frequent Commits**: Regular commits document progress and maintain a clear development history.
- **Security Conscious**: Avoided `eval()` for safer, custom logic.

## Summary

This calculator project combines solid technical skills with a strong focus on usability and clean code. Designed with modularity, error handling, and user experience in mind, itâ€™s a well-rounded example of interactive front-end development.
